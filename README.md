### Getting Started
* Download the Selenium Standalone Server and Java Client at http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ 
* Create or open an IntelliJ project 
* Add the Selenium Standalone Server and Java Client into the project
 * File > Project Structure > + > Java > selenium-server-standalone-xxx.jar

* Set up JUnit 
 * http://www.tutorialspoint.com/junit/junit_environment_setup.htm 

### What I Didn't Finish
* Running headlessly 
 * Being able to run this program without having to open a web browser. Some tools to use:
   *  HTTPUnitDriver by Selenium
    * TravisCI
* Collect run times of each request, create a spreadsheet of run times, plot a graph of the run times	
 * Use CSV library 
* Continue with JUnit integration
